# JSON XT

A Chrome extension that turns raw JSON responses into an interactive, readable tree view directly in the browser.

## What this project is

JSON XT detects JSON documents (`application/json`, `application/schema+json`, `application/vnd.api+json`, `application/ld+json`, and JSON-looking `text/plain`) and replaces the default `<pre>` output with a React-based inspector.

The goal is simple: make large API responses and JSON Schemas easier to explore without leaving the page.

## Features

- Interactive tree viewer for objects, arrays, and literals.
- Expand/collapse controls with subtree shortcuts:
  - click: toggle current node
  - `Shift` + click: expand/collapse children
  - `Alt` + click: expand/collapse full subtree
- JSON Pointer-friendly node ids, so hash links can scroll to exact fields.
- URL-aware string rendering:
  - absolute URLs are clickable
  - `#` fragments resolve against the current document URL
- `$ref` dereferencing for JSON Schema-like documents:
  - fetches referenced documents
  - resolves pointer targets
  - caches fetched JSON trees for reuse
- Manifest V3 extension architecture with content + background scripts.

## Tech stack

- React 18 + TypeScript
- Vite (custom MV3 build setup)
- Jest + React Testing Library
- Chrome Extensions Manifest V3

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ recommended
- npm (or yarn)
- Chrome/Chromium for loading the unpacked extension

### Install

```bash
npm install
```

### Run in development mode

```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts the watch build and local reload server used by the extension dev workflow.

### Build for production

```bash
npm run build
```

### Run tests

```bash
npm test
```

## Load the extension in Chrome

1. Open `chrome://extensions`.
2. Enable **Developer mode**.
3. Click **Load unpacked**.
4. Select this repo’s `dist` folder (generated by `npm run dev` or `npm run build`).
5. Reload the extension after code changes if needed.

## Project structure (high level)

- `src/pages/content/`: JSON detection, app bootstrap, and viewer components.
- `src/pages/background/`: background service worker and script injection flow.
- `src/utils/json/`: JSON type helpers + JSON Pointer parsing/resolution.
- `manifest.ts`: extension manifest source (synced with package metadata).
- `vite.config.ts`: MV3-oriented Vite/Rollup build configuration.

## Notes

- Extension name, description, and version are defined in `package.json` and fed into the generated manifest.
- Content script CSS includes a cache-busting key during build to avoid stale style caching.
